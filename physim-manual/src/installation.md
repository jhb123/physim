TODO: Packaging

The best way to install physim is get the [latest release from github](https://github.com/jhb123/physim/releases/latest) and compile it yourself. For your convenience, there is an installation script which will install physim to your home directory.

```bash

cd physim
chmod 755 install.sh
./install.sh
# Don't forget to add the installation directory to your PATH in your bash profile.
```
