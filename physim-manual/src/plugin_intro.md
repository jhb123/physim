# Introduction
This chapter will guide you through making a transform element which applies a drag that scales with the velocity of an entity. By the end of this chapter, you will know about all the fundamental parts of physim and you'll be able to create new, interesting simulations.

For more examples of elements, see the [physim repository](https://github.com/jhb123/physim)
