# Introduction
This chapter will guide you through making a transform element which applies drag to all entities in the simulation. By the end of this chapter, you will know about all the fundamental parts of `physim` and you'll be able to create new, interesting simulations.

For more examples of elements, see the [`physim` repository](https://github.com/jhb123/physim)
